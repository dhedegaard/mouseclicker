# mouseclicker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dhedegaard/mouseclicker.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dhedegaard/mouseclicker)

A simple application for doing the autoclicking in the game Clicker Heroes.

Always nice to mess around with the win32 api.

Should be buildable on most modern C++ compilers, including:

- mingw gcc 4.8.1
- Visual C++ 14.0
- clang 3.5
